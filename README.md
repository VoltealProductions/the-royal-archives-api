# The Royal Archives

## A World of Warcraft Community Website

## What is the Royal Archives?

The Royal Archives is a World of Warcraft RP Community project to create a website that can bring people and communities together.

This concept is not meant to replace how things are being done and/or managed currently it is meant to be supplimental to it. I can mostly speak for Moon Guard but a lot of events are advertised in discords, a lot of character profiles are hosted on a variety of different wikis, in particullar a lot of them are hosted on fandom.com who keeps defacing articles with more and more disruptive advertisements. We want to offer an alternative to fandom.com for the WoW community, BY the wow community. The only advertisements you see will be for player run in-game events which have not been paid for.

## Who Will This Serve?

Everyone on the US RP Realms of World of Warcraft. This is a project that was started by someone who RPs mainly on Moon Guard (US) but with Blizzard making large moves to remove the barriers between playing with friends from other realms with cross-faction groups, guilds, and most recently cross-server guilds we see no need to arbitrarily limit out site to one RP realm. The idea for this site is to help people find RP, events, and communities so there is no reason to exclude Wyrmrest Accord (US), Emerald Dream (US), and the other RP realms on the America servers from being able to use our site.

## Development Roadmap

### MVP Modules

- **Base Site Module** : The basic website and its static pages: Home, About, Terms, FAQ, Contact, ETC
- **User Module** : Manage user accounts and information. At most this will require a (non-public) email, display name, password, and visibility toggle.
- **Character Module** : Manage users that are linked to your user account.
- **Event Module** : Manage events that are linked to your user account and characters.

### Full Release Modules

- **Guild Module** : Guilds can be managed by the Guild Master and their officers.
- **News Module** : A module spesifically to find In-Character news papers.
- **Adventure Module** : A place for user created (in universe) stories, poems, etc.
- **Noticeboard Module**: A place to put notices that have been posted in certain cities / major locations across the in-game world.

### To be patched in later

- **Gallery Module**: These are the things that need to be figured out how to handle in a cost effective manner first. While I would love to let users upload their art to the website there things that need to be considered. Images require a lot of storage space which is expensive, letting users upload things is also a security risk not to mention trolls could try uploaidn illigal content, stolen art is an issue too, and of course there needs to be an answer to the AI question.

### Far Future Ideas

- TRP 3 Profile Import
- Roleplay Guides / Advice pages
- WoW head news integration? (not sure about this)
- Windows/Mac/Linux Desktop App
- A Wiki style sub-website

## Tech Stack Info

## Planned Server Security Features

- **Anubis**: Weigh the soul of incoming HTTP requests using proof-of-work to stop AI crawlers.

## Contributing

We are currently not looking for contributors. We are still working on making our MVP. Once we have our MVP (minimum viable product) out and we start letitng people test the initial product we will start looking for people to help with the project. If you are interested however you can contact me on discord or in-game on one of the following characters: Ishathepious, Bishopishala, Abbessishala, Volteal. Once we get out of the MVP stage we're going to need volenteer programmers, artists, and UX designers.
